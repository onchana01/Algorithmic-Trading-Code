# Algorithmic-Trading-Code
# Algorithmic Trading Platform

A Python-based platform for high-frequency trading analysis, designed to stream real-time stock data, analyze trends, and generate trading strategies for research purposes. **Not intended for production trading or actual purchases**â€”this is an experimental tool for exploring quantitative trading concepts.

## Overview
This project simulates an algorithmic trading environment, integrating real-time data from Alpaca API, historical data via yfinance, and a time-series database (InfluxDB). It implements Momentum, Mean-Reversion, and Arbitrage strategies, visualizes signals with Dash, and backtests performance using Backtrader. The setup is containerized with Docker for portability and scalability.

### Features
- **Real-Time Data**: Streams 1-minute stock bars (e.g., AAPL, SPY) using Alpaca API.
- **Trend Analysis**: Generates signals with three strategies:
  - *Momentum*: Based on price change thresholds.
  - *Mean-Reversion*: Using Simple Moving Averages (SMA).
  - *Arbitrage*: Analyzing price spreads between tickers.
- **Visualization**: Interactive Dash dashboard (`http://localhost:8050`) with price trends and signals.
- **Backtesting**: Simulates strategies on 5-day historical data,  yielding $9109.53 from $10,000 (Momentum strategy).
- **Data Storage**: InfluxDB for efficient time-series management.
- **Dockerized**: Runs via Docker Compose with `app` and `influxdb` services.

### Sample Backtest Plot

*Caption*: Backtest of Momentum strategy on AAPL (5 days, 1-min intervals), showing price trends and trades, ending with $9109.53 from $10,000.
